Hello {person}!

Your assignment in the 2024 Kris Kindle is: <b>{assignment}</b>.

Can you believe it's November already? Where does the time go.

You might be interested to learn that there's a new rule added to the Kris Kindle logic this year: you can't get \
someone that you got last year. (Don't worry, Ailbhe, I got you covered!)

The suggested amount to spend is <b>approximately â‚¬30 or $30</b>. No problem if you'd to spend a little more or less.

Here's a couple of Christmas jokes to get you in a yuletide mood:

Q: Why are Santa's helpers depressed?
A: <s>The election.</s> Because they have low elf-esteem.

Q: What do you call enthusiasts of the game of chess bragging about past wins in a hotel lobby?
A: Chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.

Let me know if you have any questions. Have fun shopping for your Kris Kindle!

Kris :-)"""
